                            school senior who's just learning web development. Currently, I'm just building my
                            portfolio and so it may feel like the website isn't as professional as a person who's
                            got a good looking resume. However, I'll be building out websites and quickly
                            learn so that I can become a professional web developer with experinence under my belt.
                            I've had 2 major pivots of my life where I've deeply focused on something niche, and
                            those
                            are being on self improvement (Aug 2022-Present) and being a web developer (Oct

                                    block out distracting elemenets of youtube. It holds a special place in my heart
                                    because it was one of the larger motivators that drove me into web development.
                                    I created this project in order to not make youtube as big of a distraction. I
                                    enjoyed the project so
                                    much that I ended up upgrading it in May 2024 for an engineering project at
                                    school with my friends. Go check it out - its on the website (Coming soon).

                                    very simple in terms of how it works. All it does is simply use a bit of
                                    Javascript to locate the elements that are distracting (eg thumbnails, shorts,
                                    comments) and either delete them, or hide them. There are easy ways to do both
                                    of these for those who don't have a CS background. Other than that core feature,
                                    I just added a user setting toggle that sets the
                                    script to delete or hide elements based on what the user wants. I've learned so
                                    much, from the basics of javascript and understanding HTML DOM structures to
                                    grappling with chrome extension setups and github documentation. Overall, an
                                    amazing beginner project and a useful tool to my life.

                                chunks of text from a website so that ChatGPT can have context or analyize
                                website content. However, this project has been discontinued with the addition
                                of ChatGPT being able to access the web itself, which is why it isn't on chrome
                                extensions.

                            <div class="text-xl mt-6">I enjoyed making this project, and it severely put my
                                resilience to the test. Unexpected obstacles popped up all over the
                                place, such as learning how to web-scrape and filter the right text, painfully
                                figuring out the structure and functions of ChatGPT's javascript so that I can
                                fit my code in without breaking the chatbot, avoiding CORS policies, etc.
                                Problem after problem ended up extending this project from 2 weeks into 2
                                months, and I finished on April 2024. On the way, I learned so much, from
                                analyzing front-end code, to creating cloud functions, and the asynchronous
                                nature of JS. It has greatly expanded my knowledge about web development, and
                                has allowed me to take a look into backend JS coding, which I will probably
                                expand on later.

                                    is a manual block, where the user puts in website domains ahead of time and then
                                    when they involunteraily access it later, the extension will auto-block the user
                                    from accessing the website. It's very similar to the cold turkey app or the
                                    chrome extension blocksite in that sense. The second part was to access the
                                    user's google calendar, and based on the event, will use AI to actively
                                    determine if the website is related to the event or not when the user opens a

                                    OpenAI API, I thought I could leverage that in order to automatically block
                                    websites that aren't related to the google calendar event. However, it was
                                    impractical to dynamically block since OAuth2.0 work only on google chrome, which
                                    restricted my extension
                                    usage to people who used google chrome only (and not other chromium based
                                    browsers such as arc, firefox, and opera), and the cost of the API was too
                                    expensive. Also I needed a server or else API keys would
                                    be exposed. However, this project was still a
                                    sucuess in the sense that I was able to learn along the way, such as OAuth2.0,
                                    API, dependencies, and even some backend javascript.

                                Personal Growth or Self-improvement is the process of consciously seeking to enhance
                                one's knowledge, skills, character, and/or overall quality of life. It's the activity
                                of identifying personal goals and aspirations, acknowledging areas of weakness or
                                potential growth, and taking proactive steps to develop oneself. This can encompass
                                a wide range of activities, from pursuing education and optimizing productivity
                                to cultivating healthier habits, improving relationships, and fostering mental and
                                emotional well-being.
                                It's a lifelong journey that encourages people to become the best versions of
                                themselves, continually evolving and adapting to meet the
                                challenges and opportunities life presents. The beauty is that this activity can be
                                done by anyone, at any time, and regardless of who they are. As long as individuals
                                put in the effort, they will see the results - this is exactly why I love the game of
                                personal development so much.

                                not, a certain caliber of character is being built that shapes who you are. However,
                                with self improvement, we can take that into our own hands
                                Instead of passively letting the enviornment, subconsious behaviors, and the people
                                around you determine your life, you can determine your own character, your own habits,
                                and your own mindsets to become the person you wish to become. Especially in an
                                enviornment where attention is the new currancy and modern innovations take advantage
                                of pre-built psychology (eg FOMO, lust, dopamine systens) to systemically force their
                                customers to use their products, it has become more evident
                                and important to discipline ones self and have a clear cut purpose in mind. This is why
                                self improvement matters so much; the lifestyle has become a fundemental cornernstone
                                for anyone who wishes to accomplish something in life. By taking on
                                the journey of self improvement, you can increase productivity, focus, resilience,
                                self-awareness, adaptablitiy, compassion, empathy, and individual empowerment to
                                whatever extent you wish. It builds character in a way that no external source can do.
                                The ripple effects include significantly greater overall joy in life, the formation of
                                new, healthier, and strengthened relationships, immense jumps in productivity, sharper
                                thinking and self-awareness, and greatly improved overall health.

                                This does sound like a silver bullet, but it is a tough silver bullet to take. Its a
                                continuious journey that requires commitment, discipline, and time to craft. I've been
                                living the lifestyle of someone on self improvement for nearly 2 years and I still feel
                                like I have so much to go and so much to learn - about my emotions, my past, my work
                                potential. But isn't that the beauty of life, to keep discovering, adapting, and
                                experiencing. If you're interested in starting self improvement, just pick an area you
                                wish to be better at and just start pouring hours into getting that idealized version of
                                that aspect into reality (eg I want to be fit, so I focus ruthlessly on exercising,
                                diet, researching best techniques, crafting an identiy around being an athlete, etc.) or
                                you can join self improvement communities and they can get you up to speed.

                                followed the school system and my parents - get good grades, make friends at school,
                                have some
                                extraciriculars that I didn't really try in because my parents forced me to do them, and
                                play in the digital world. Although I always knew at the back of my mind that I was
                                addicted to the internet and especially to video games, wasn't everybody? It was an
                                ignorant existance, and up to 2019, everything felt fine. Everything felt normal.

                                Everyone knows what happened in 2020. I remember being in 7th grade in my 6th period
                                class having our teacher announce to us that today was apparently the last day we'd have
                                school for an "unknown amount of time". Following what the school told us, we went
                                online to continue our learning, and that temptation at being at home and the first
                                introduction to discord unlocked a pandora's box. A new parrallel of video game playing
                                and online indulgence. I still vividly remember playing minecraft for hours at a time
                                during school hours, laughing to memes with my online friends, and attempting to take
                                screenshots of each other on zoom meetings. But, as the online year came and went, and
                                others adjusted back to a regular life, I still stayed stuck in the online realm.
                                Anytime I could get my hands on my phone, or on my computer, a video game would always
                                be in the background. Sometimes, I'd get up at 2AM just to grind a nightly session of
                                roblox. The amount of things I sacrificed to feed my ever-starving video game addiction
                                was unparralleled.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The thing that made me snap out of this pigeon hole was that even my video game friends
                                were starting to move on. They were taking classes, working at jobs, and teaching skills
                                to younger children. It felt
                                shameful to have done nothing but play games all summer, so shameful that I got pissed;
                                pissed at video games, pissed at myself, pissed at the other habits like eating junk
                                food and having youtube and discord to assist my video game addiction. I was done with
                                games, and I wanted out.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                With nothing to my name, and all the challenges ahead of me, there was only relentless
                                determination. After weeks of experimentation and research, I realized the only way
                                forward was to replace these addictions with healthier hobbies. I created the four
                                cornerstone activities that would eventually become the foundation of my self
                                improvement journey: Exercise, Meditation, Reading, and Journaling. I knew that I needed
                                to train and maximize my physical, mental, and spiritual health if I were to reclaim my
                                life. To integrate these four habits into my life, I created a daily routine to
                                reconstruct my personal habits. Where I once was sluggishly waking up at 7:30am to catch
                                the bus for school, my morning routine consisted of a 20 minute journaling session, a 10
                                minute meditation, a 5 minute cold shower, and a 20 minute cardio workout all before
                                8:30am. Afterschool, instead of playing rounds of clash royale on the bus home with my
                                friends, I biked to the gym and spent 75 minutes weightlifting. Before I went to bed, I
                                educated myself by reading for 45 minutes rather than hyperstimulate my brain with
                                youtube or video games.

                                <br>
                                The first 2 months of this transformation was a daily mental battleground, where the
                                allure of reverting to the comfort of hedonic pleasures clashed with my unwavering
                                resolve to take back my life. In these moments, discipline and humility emerged as my
                                guiding principles. The creation of these very tough habits required the commitment to
                                show up even when I didn't want to, and to resist the pleasures even though I felt like
                                it. It also forced me to acknowledge and learn from setbacks while cultivating the
                                patience to persevere through adversity. Each small victory served as a reminder of my
                                capacity for growth and resilience, fueling my determination to press onward despite the
                                obstacles that lay ahead. As the days went past, I felt more and more capable of
                                resisting the urges to waste time, and I slowly adjusted to my new identity.

                                <br>
                                After 4 grueling months filled with progress, setbacks, victories, and losses, I didn't
                                feel the need to go back to the habitual distractions that once had complete control
                                over me. This project was a holistic transformation of my physical, mental, and
                                spiritual well-being, and I didn't expect my life to take such a pivotal turn. I have
                                emerged stronger, more resilient, and deeply enriched by this experience, and it opened
                                a whole new world of challenges for me to tackle that I never even knew existed before
                                embarking on this journey. As I stand at the threshold of future endeavors, I carry with
                                me the invaluable lessons gleaned from this journey, ready to confront challenges with
                                discipline, humility, and perseverance.

                                            For those who don't know what a dopamine detox is, it's a challenge of
                                            temperance. The person on the challenge just goes cold turkey on their
                                            addictions for a certain span of weeks, and restricts themselves from
                                            getting that hedonic high you feel whenever you do something really fun for
                                            a certain period of time. This is done so that you get rid of the accustomed
                                            "high state" from unnaturally easy ways to get dopamine (video games, social
                                            media, junk food, YT, etc.), allowing you to enjoy the truly joyful things
                                            in life. Usually, it lasts for about 2 weeks, but doing it for a week, 4
                                            days, or even a year is still going to benefit.

                                            To me, this project is a recurring activity. The dopamine detox is perfect
                                            to start a season of work and productivity, and so I usually cycle it once
                                            per 3-4 months. I've done at least 6 separate detoxes, all with varying
                                            lengths and rules depending on what I want to optimize for. For example, on
                                            my first detox when I left music out, I realized music was actually being
                                            destructive towards my goals, so I banned it during my next dopamine detox
                                            cycle. In addition, I realized I needed a channel of communication, so I
                                            opened up my discord again for that purpose. However, the main goal of
                                            dopamine detoxes is to reset my mind so that I can do something very
                                            difficult with much less resistance.

                                            This recurring project has and will continue to humble, discipline, and
                                            empower me. I've learned so much when it comes to my psyche, how I can use
                                            that to my own advantage, the nuanced relationships between external factors
                                            and intrinsic motivation and behavior, and so much more. Not only has the
                                            structure and mindset of a dopamine detox tremendously boosted my
                                            productivity, but it also just makes me a more joyful and grateful person.
                                            It's one of the best tools anyone can learn, and this project was the reason
                                            why I was able to stay motivated and get through the chasm of pain and toil
                                            when I first started out my self-improvement journey. I owe a lot to this
                                            concept.

                                            This project was supposed to be 30 books in 30 days and I started this
                                            because I read one book of the hunger games to just re-read fiction and I
                                            fell in love with it - took 2 days for me to finish the series. After that
                                            fiasco, I just decided to continue reading, and made it into a fun
                                            challenge. I genuinely tried, but books are difficult to speed read without
                                            having their value being destroyed. Most of the books I read were fictional,
                                            and I did this as a fun challenge. Each fictional book was approximately 350
                                            pages,
                                            and I spent an average of 6 hours per day dedicated to reading. Even my
                                            school work came after my reading, and although I kept my grades up, it was
                                            very tedious. Some book series I read were the trilogy "The Hunger Games",
                                            the trilogy and its fourth add-on "Legend", and the entire series "Orphan X"
                                            (9 books). I also read and finished a non-fiction book as well, but we won't
                                            count it to make the numbers look nicer.

                                            surprisingly learned a good deal just binge-reading for 40 days straight.
                                            When I was young, I never enjoyed reading at all, my parents would force me
                                            to read books. However, this experience taught me that as long as you put in
                                            the time, you can enjoy anything. I've substantially improved my vocabulary,
                                            my speaking, reading, and writing capabilities, and my compassion and
                                            empathy for people. Definitely recommend reading fiction to anyone who has
                                            the bandwidth to do it, but don't get carried away like I did because with
                                            good books, it's very easy.

                                                therapy</a>, the 100 fears challenge is just a broader experimental
                                            challenge where instead of the goal is to get a "no" from someone to feel
                                            rejection, the goal is to get uncomfortable and be okay being uncomfortable
                                            and doing scary things. Rejection is part of that, and although many of the
                                            tasks I do are inspired from that challenge, I've also created different
                                            challenges and put my own spin to this.

                                            This is a work in progress and I'm just over a quarter of the way left. I
                                            expect to be finished before college apps so I can write about it but so far
                                            it's been really fun. Many of these challenges have been socially awkward,
                                            as I don't want to spend too much time on each individual challenge.
                                            Therefore, many of these challenges, are tailored to getting into socially
                                            awkward situations.

                                        <div class="what-I've-learned">
                                            I've learned so much about fear, courage, and discipline from this
                                            challenge. Even though I have not finished yet, I've already seen a huge
                                            jump in capability to take on difficult and scary things. I've also realized
                                            how many fallacies our mind plays on us, and you can get away with much more
                                            in the social world than most people think. I've also learned to stop caring
                                            about what other people think of me, which is a very big personal
                                            accomplishment for anyone. Finally, I've learned how to actually calculate
                                            risk (because I did my research before jumping into such a difficult
                                            challenge) and it has liberated me to do so much more than if I were to not
                                            have these lessons I learned from these first-hand experiences. What a
                                            journey so far, and I expect to have even more fun in the future.
